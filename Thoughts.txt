I want to track machine times.
A machine must be in some state at all times
    Setup   - Job
    Run     - Job
    Idle   

I need t know what job against. How many parts produced and what scrap

A machine is really a production station.
A station has
    name
    description
    must links to a schedule for availaility, or default to something
    must belong to a department
    may belong to a group , cell , line
    current status
    

A department has a 
    name 
    description
    list of stations
